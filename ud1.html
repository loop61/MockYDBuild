      <p><strong>Coding and Design Concepts</strong></p>
      <p class="learn">Kids learn not only the most important concepts in programming such as
        conditional statements, variables, methods, parameters, and loops, but
        they also learn essential design principles as they lay out and design
        their 3D Environment.</p>
      <p><strong>Industry-standard Game Development Workflows</strong></p>
      <p class="learn">​Kids learn  the same fundamentals that are utilized in real Game Studios
        around the world including the use of prefabs, debugging, waypoints,
        particle systems, randomization, and more..</p>
      <p><strong>Unity®, a Professional Software</strong></p>
      <p class="learn">​​Kids learn how to use Unity®, the same professional software used to
        create Temple Run®, Pokémon Go®, and Myst®. It is one of the most powerful
        and widely-used Game Engines in the world and can export to iOS, Android,
        PC, Mac, XBox, PS4, Oculus, Cardboard, and Web.*</p>
      <h6 class="learn">*The game made during the course will be compatible with PC and Mac.</h6>
      <p><strong>How to make a real Game</strong></p>
      <p class="learn">Kids learn how to make a video game that looks like the ones they’d want
        to play. They also have creative control over the look and feel of the
        game and will be so excited to share what they’ve created with family
        and friends!</p>
