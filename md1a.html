      <h2 class = "slant2">​In Mod Design 1: Adventure Maps Kids Learn:​</h2>
      <p><strong>Foundational Coding Concepts</strong></p>
      <p class="learn">- Kids use a command-line interface to code their Adventure Maps, drawing
        on core coding concepts along the way. In order to add all the features
        they want, they’ll declare and manage variables, create conditional if-then
        and if-else statements, implement logical operators and boolean flags,
        and pass appropriate parameters to a variety of functions. </p>
      <p><strong>Think like a Programmer</strong></p>
      <p class="learn">- ​As kids string together Command Blocks in order to add new features,
        they’ll need to conquer all of the same difficulties as a professional
        programmer. They’ll use computational and critical thinking to achieve the
        correct logical flow, reference code documentation to understand required
        parameters, and use standard debugging techniques when their game is not
        working as expected.</p>
      <p><strong>MCEdit, a Powerful 3D Modeling Tool</strong></p>
      <p class="learn">- ​​Rather than building their games block-by-block in Minecraft®, kids will
        use a 3D Modeling tool that allows them to design a beautiful world efficiently.
        MCEdit shares some powerful functionality with professional 3D Modeling programs
        that allows them to quickly transform and manipulate objects in a 3-dimensional
        space to achieve their desired result.</p>
      <p><strong>How to make a Pro-Level Adventure Map</strong></p>
      <p class="learn">- Kids learn how to make an Adventure Map that looks and plays just like
        the ones they have seen online. They’ll use the same techniques as professional
        Minecraft® map-makers to create an incredible game that they can share with
        family and friends.</p>
