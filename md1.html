      <h2 class="slant">Meet the Teacher:</h2>
      <p>When Justin saw Toy Story for the first time as a kid, he knew he
          wanted to work with technology when he grew up. Since then, he’s been
          creating, teaching, and  working on his Enderdragon impressions. He
          took everything he learned as a kid, and working with kids, and turned
          it into Youth Digital. Now you can learn how to code with Youth
          Digital’s founder.</p>

      <p><strong>Foundations of Java™ </strong></p>

        world, including instantiation, methods, parameters, loops and more.</p>
      <p><strong>Industry-standard Coding Skills</strong></p>
      <p class="learn">​Kids learn how to mod like the pros as they sort through complex
        source code, edit and fine-tune attribute values, properly comment
        their code, and fix bugs as they arise.</p>
      <p><strong>Eclipse, a Professional Software</strong></p>
      <p class="learn">​Kids learn to use Eclipse, the same Java™ Development kit used by
        professionals to create Minecraft® and many other commercial programs.</p>
      <p><strong>How to make a real Mod</strong></p>
      <p class="learn">Kids learn how to create a real mod using the same tools and
        techniques as the most well-known modders. At the end of the course,
        they can easily share their mod with friends!</p>
